Sets modifying CSS selector (and optionally a title) for element state.

A special kind of modifier that doesn't represent any valuable variation of element, but only some special state.

Commonly, it corresponds to some pseudo-class (or sometimes a regular class, or a combination of those), like `:checked` or `.active`.

Multiple states can be listed within the same section.


Handling in documentor
-----
In StyleDoc documentor, state doesn't produce separate showcase item (as opposed to [@modifier]({% post_url 0000-01-01-modifier %}), which does).

Instead, all state modifiers are sequentially applied within each showcase subsection.

Thus, base and each modifier also get all the states applied.

{% include status/label/not_implemented.html %} This behavior can be disabled by setting documentor option.


Documentor limitation
-----
Current version of StyleDoc documentor tool only supports CSS modifications that can by applied by creating or altering some HTML attribute(s).

That means, `:hover`, `:focus` or `:empty` states are useless for documentor, though `:checked` or `:readonly` will work (`<input type="checkbox" checked>`).
